I fit this role because I have a strong drive for solving hard problems. My background in high-level research has taught me resilience and critical thinking, while my passion for AI drives me to build practical solutions. I am self-taught, autonomous, and comfortable with ambiguity. I am looking for a team that values output and creativity over traditional backgrounds, and I am ready to contribute immediately with a unique perspective on problem-solving.
